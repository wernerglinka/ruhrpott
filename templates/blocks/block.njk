{#
  renderBlock is a generic nunjucks macro that uses the name parameter to compose the name of the target block macro. Since Nunjucks doesn't support dynamic macro names, we have to use a helper function to do this.

{% macro renderBlock(name, params, site) %}
  {% include "../blocks/" + name + ".njk" ignore missing %}
{% endmacro %}
